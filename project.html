    <p>We decided to choose "NASA's Artemis Goals for the Moon" because of a slight inspiration from our team's name.</p>

        <p>The following will explain our process of drafting and proposing this project to NASA Scientists.</p>     
        <div id="checkpoint-1"> <h5>Checkpoint 1: Goal</h5> The reason Artemis Green chose these goals is because they fit within our projected budget, power, and weight constraints. To determine our goals we made use of a tool called JMars and defined several possible landing zones on the moon, then we directed our focus toward the potential science instruments. Using an excel spreadsheet created by a team member we are able to plug in values to determine a finalized combination of components on our gameboard, and this gives foresight on our potential constraints depending on what we decide to purchase from the Virtual Store. Using this spreadsheet, we found that we had enough weight and power to store the instruments necessary to completing our goals/mission objectives.

        <div id="checkpoint-2"> <h5>Checkpoint 2: Cards</h5> <p>Computer Engineer Card:

          For the Computer Systems card, we chose the Advanced Microprocessor card. As we plan to test a habitat on the surface of the moon while also trying to utilize in-situ resources, it is immensely important to have a computer system that can not only handle all of the incoming data from our various, planned science systems, but one that can handle a certain amount of autonomy. The system will theoretically need to be able to process data gathered from the lunar surface as well as monitor systems in the habitat and make adjustments automatically in order to keep the environment livable. In thinking ahead to potential science card uses, having an advanced microprocessor would be critical in maintaining a functioning Life Science Laboratory as well. To assure long term success and reliability a Radiation Hardened Single-Board Computer (Rad-Hard SBC) will be utilized. Our Rad-Hard SBC, developed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory, will be low power, consuming only 6.6 watts and be designed to withstand the shock and vibration encountered during a satellite launch (Merl et al., 2018). 
        </p>
        <p>
          Propulsion Engineer Card:

	The Green Team’s major problem moving forward with a rocket is the consideration of cost, reliability, and power. The choice of a mission centered around a human habitat on the Moon reduces our mass requirements, with the lunar habitat requiring half the mass of the Mars habitat. The Medium-Lift Rockets will be able to accommodate the habitat, as well as providing enough lift for additional scientific instruments. The option B, stated in the NASA Card Handbook, offers a slightly higher reliability rate for 20 Million Dollars more. With the absolute consideration of safety, the Artemis Green Team feels completely comfortable with utilizing the Medium-Lift Rocket B for its reliability.
	The addition of the Nose Cone was crucial to the safety and advancement of our program. The Nose Cone will add protection by housing the entire mission payload, while reducing the damage caused by acoustic dynamics during launch and flight. The aerodynamic stability of the rocket requires the addition of a nose cone. The mission’s budget was barely affected by the cost of the Nose Cone; costing merely 10 Million.

          Science Instruments: The first thing we made sure we had was the Radiation Sensor, as that would be necessary for testing the potential for human habitation off of earth as well as making sure that any astronauts that visited the habitat would be safe from a dangerous amount of radiation by using the sensor to find safe spots.
          Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD):
        This instrument monitors naturally occurring radiation that poses a health risk to astronauts. The Rad will measure radiation during its trip to the moon and on the surface of the moon. This will provide data to confirm our astronauts are being kept safe during flight and while living on the moon. It will also provide data to help map the distribution of radiation between the earth and the moon. The RAD is energy efficient and lightweight tool that will provide valuable information about long term habitats on other planetary bodies (Webster). 
        
          Along with the Radiation Sensor, we felt that adding the Life Sciences Laboratory would be immensely beneficial to researching how life would be sustained off of earth. Not only that, but in combination with the radiation sensor, the life sciences laboratory could be used to evaluate how well the air and water filtration units in the habitat functioned and safely maintained a livable environment off of earth. Since we added the life sciences laboratory, we made sure to include the sample collection device, not only because it is required but because we would need a device to gather soil samples from projects in the life sciences laboratory to test for radiation saturation. This lab will also help support experiments with Plant growth, Biomolecular, Microbial, Chemistry, and astrobiology in low gravity environments (Limpert). 
          Another card we felt essential to add was the Mass Spectrometer Observing Lunar Operations to assist us in achieving our goal of utilizing in-situ resources. Not only does this card point out potential locations where water may be present, it also points out potential locations for other materials such as iron and titanium. Being able to pinpoint possible locations with this module would be very valuable in finding resources that could be used to maintain the mission in the long term.

          Communication Cards:

	Due to the location of our landing site all communication will need to be relayed through an orbiting satellite. Communication will have to be completed as quickly as possible due to the time the satellite is within line of site. This will require the High-Gain Antenna. High gain antennas have a focused beam and are reliant on their direction to function properly. Therefore all High-Gain antennas have a gimbal mechanism to aim the antenna at the receiver during transmission(Antennas). The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), a satellite that completed its own mission in 2011, but is still in service today, will be repurposed to relay communication to and from our habitat at a speed of  100mbps(Shah). 
	For redundancy in the communication system, a Low-Gain Antenna will be included on our mission. This is a low cost back-up that will be able to communicate even if there is failure of the High-Gain antenna and even allow for recalibration of the High-Gain Antenna if it should lose track of the satellite. Low-Gain Antennas are wide beam antennas and unlike the High-Gain Antenna. The deep space network can still send and receive data even if the antenna is not pointed directly at a receiver (Antennas). Glen research center has a EMI chamber for testing the antenna’s 
	With the number of science instruments included on our mission, a Main Memory Card will be extremely important to keep track of all of the data. Each day the memory card will be offloaded to orbiting satellites and re-transmitted back to earth.

          Mechanical Components:
	In our search for In-Situ resource utilization a large drill will be required for taking samples of lunar soil and rock from deep below the surface. The Trident drill has been designed for autonomous acquisition of samples up to one meter below the surface. This drill has many sensors to detect the movements of each motor and allow it to adapt to any condition we might find on the lunar surface. If it finds a harder then normal rock it can apply more pressure, If it gets lodged in place it can dislodge itself and then continue drilling (Tavares, 2019). This drill can be manually set up by astronauts. Testing of the drill will be tested at the Haughton Crater on Devon Island, Canada. One of the most moon-like places on earth resembling the scale of Shackleton Crater, very similar to the shoemaker crater (Fong et al., 2008).
